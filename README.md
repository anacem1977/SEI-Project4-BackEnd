## General Info
The app allows for creation of new user accounts, login, editing, and deletion of the same.  Once logged in, the user will have access to display the information available for beers, as well as to "like" beers by brand. 

## Planning
The Back-End of the app is built on a PostgresSQL database.  Tables included: 
+ **Origins** (style, country of origin and description)
+ **Substyles** (substyle, description, abv, ibu, glassware, pairing, flavor, color; foreign-key: *styleId*)
+ **Brands** (brand, abv, likes; foreign-keys: *substyleId, breweryId*)
+ **Breweries** (name, address, url)
